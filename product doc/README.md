# Blue Morpho Platform Overview

The **Blue Morpho** platform is designed to help you build all kinds of **AI agents**, **apps**, and **workflows** on top of **enterprise data**.

## Why Blue Morpho?

The platform is built with a focus on making enterprise AI:

- **Scalable**: Our Knowledge Layer is a solid foundation to automate not just one workflow, but all your workflows.
- **Reliable**: The Knowledge Layer serves as well-structured context to AI agents, making it easy for them to find and use the right data.
- **Widely Accessible**: Blue Morpho brings together both technical builders and subject matter experts.

## Introductory Concepts

As you get started with Blue Morpho, think of the platform as being organized into three layers:

### 1. Data Layer

Data is stored in **Collections**, which support two types of data:

- **Unstructured**: such as `.pdf`, `.txt`
- **Structured**: such as `.csv`

Collections typically originate from organizational data sources, either:

- Uploaded manually
- Or (coming soon) ingested programmatically via the **Blue Morpho SDK**

Each Collection is processed through an **Extraction Run**, which extracts, transforms, and enriches the data to build the **Knowledge Layer**.

Connectors to enterprise sources can be provided [upon request](mailto:hello@getbluemorpho.com).

### 2. Knowledge Layer (Business Context Layer)

The Knowledge Layer captures your business context in two key structures:

#### Ontologies

Ontologies define **business concepts** (e.g., `Driver`, `Vehicle`, `Trip`) and their **properties** (e.g., `name`, `address`, `SSN`).

#### Knowledge Graphs

A Knowledge Graph connects **entities** with their **relationships**.  
For example, the Driver "John Doe" might be linked to his Vehicle and Trips using relations like `hasVehicle`, `hasTrip`.

Together, the Ontology and Knowledge Graph form a **Knowledge Base**, which is generated by an **Extraction Run**.

The Knowledge Base ensures that your data is:

- **Well-defined**, thanks to the Ontology
- **Linked and resolved**, through relations in the Knowledge Graph

This structure makes it easy for AI agents to find and use the right data reliably.

### 3. Application Layer

This layer enables you to build and run AI applications that access and reason over your data.

#### Internal Agents

Blue Morpho includes built-in agents for:

- Answering queries based on your data
- Building reports that auto-update as the Knowledge Base evolves

#### External Agents

Agents that operate outside of Blue Morpho can connect to its Knowledge Layer using the **Model Context Protocol**.

## Summary

| Layer              | Purpose                                                             |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Layer**     | Collect and structure unstructured/structured enterprise data        |
| **Knowledge Layer**| Turn raw data into linked business context via ontologies and graphs |
| **Application Layer** | Build agents and apps that reason over structured business knowledge  |
